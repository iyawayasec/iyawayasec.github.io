<p>He started his educational journey in 2002 at Mondo Primary School and later joined Secondary Education at Bugisha Secondary School located in Kahama town council, Tanzania </p>
<p>His school-life journey started well due  to his hard work and excellence in studies but turned into a bitter aloe in 2005 while he was in the fourth grade (standard four) when he suddenly fell ill with osteomyelitis (a disease caused by infection and inflammation in the bone) that led him to drop out of school for a long time (from July 2005 to  May 2006).</p>

</p>
<p>His classmates say Kuleha,was a funny,compassionate and cooperative student.</p>

<p>His mastery in English vocabulary led his classmates to nickname him Dictionary as they claimed they were able to get the translation of any English vocabulary without the need of  an English-Swahili dictionary.</p> 

<p>In 2010 as a second former (FII) , he was forced to drop out of school again to pursue treatment for health challenges that were still plaguing him. </p>

Disappointed with school, in February 2013, he met his Physics teacher Jumanne Jackson (well known as mwalimu Jacky) who mentored and helped him get back to school to continue his studies. 
 <br>
<p>In May 2013, Kuleha returned to school after permit from the regional administrative secretary given to continue with Form Three and finally graduated Form Four in 2015.</p>

He was selected to join advanced secondary education at Pugu Boys Secondary School in Ilala municipality, Dar es Salaam city of Tanzania to study Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

 <br><br>
<p>At Pugu, he was a disciplined and diligent student in studies but health challenges did not stop so he studied with difficulty. 

With singing being his hobby, while at school he loved singing especially songs by diamond (nimpende nani and lala salama)  and American artists like Lil Wayne (lollipop), Chris Brown (transform ya) , West life (queen of my heart) , Designer  (panda) etc.</p> 

<p>He performed at the Form Six Farewell ceremony 2017 and since then was nicknamed PANDA, the name of the song he performed from Designer.

Since then the boys (Pugu boys students) improved the nickname Dictionary to Google  to appreciate his vocabulary mastery in
 English language.</p> 

"This is not just a dictionary, it is a Google search engine" One of the students was heard  saying !! and this marked the beginning of the nickname Google he is known for up to date. 
 <br>
<p>In July 2018, after graduating from Form Six, he was selected to join the National Service Army known as Jeshi la Kujenga Taifa (JKT) at 843 military camp, Nachingwea to learn some military and life skills.

Nevertheless, he reported  at the Ruvu military camp of 832 kj where he was famously  known as Google the artist due to his love of singing.</p>
